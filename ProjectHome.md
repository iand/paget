Paget is a framework for building linked data applications. At the moment it is focussed on publishing data but I intend for it to be capable of managing updates too.

It requires the [moriarty](http://code.google.com/p/moriarty) library and supports but does not require the use of the Talis Platform.

If you're new to Paget then you ought to read about Paget's [Basic Concepts](http://code.google.com/p/paget/wiki/BasicConcepts) and then move onto the [Getting Started](http://code.google.com/p/paget/wiki/GettingStarted) guide.

Paget is in use at:

  * http://iandavis.com/id/me - my personal linked data space
  * http://placetime.com/ - a data space for places and times
  * http://vocab.org/whisky/ - a vocabulary for describing whisky varieties

I've written several blog posts on Paget which you can find [here](http://iandavis.com/blog/tags/paget)
